This is a project which we are implementing at the Public University of Navarre.
This is just a repository to be able to carry a correct control of versions in our programs.
The process consists on treating the images obtained from the Sentinel satellite, to create mosaics containing the Navarre boundaries. After that some statistics are obtained.

The aim of the project is to be able to classify the cultives in the correct classes based on the inspections and declarations. To do so, a Random Forest classifier is implemented.
